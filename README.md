 ## ðŸ›  **Tech Stack**
- Frontend: React, React Router, Context API, CSS/SCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- External API: TheMovieDB
- Auth: JWT (access & refresh tokens)
- Emails: Nodemailer
- Payments: Stripe / PayPal (mock or live)
- Cloud: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## âš™ **Architecture**
- React frontend â†’ communicates with Node.js backend (REST API)
- Backend handles business logic, payments, emails, user management
- MongoDB stores users, reviews, favourites, payments
- TheMovieDB API provides live movie & actor data
- Dockerized services, deployed on GKE

## ðŸ“¦ Project structure
- `/backend`: Node.js + Express.js backend, JWT auth, payments, emails
- `/src`: React frontend (TS), pages, components, context
- `/k8s`: Kubernetes manifests (deployments, services)
- `/public`: static assets and icons
- `docker-compose.yml`: local development setup

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## ðŸ§ª **How to run locally**
1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-app-ts.git
cd movie-app-ts

cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install

Add .env files for backend (Mongo URI, JWT secrets, TMDB API key, email creds, payment keys)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
